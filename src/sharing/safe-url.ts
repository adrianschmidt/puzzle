 * `//evil.example/x.png` also throws in `new URL()` yet resolves cross-origin
 * (a relative ref inherits the base's scheme, not origin) — hence the sentinel
 * base in {@link isSameOriginRelative}.
 *

 * (`blob:` deliberately — the only createObjectURL is the save-download anchor,
 * never an image, and a sharer's blob is dead on the recipient's machine).
 * Host is NOT checked: http(s) is accepted for any host, because no scheme
 * check separates Unsplash from `evil.example`. The origin policy that stops a
 * tracking pixel lives in the `img-src` CSP in index.html.
