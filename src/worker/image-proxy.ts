/**
 * Cloudflare Worker: Unsplash API proxy. The app is a static site, so a
 * build-time key is inlined into the bundle and readable by every visitor
 * (#534); this Worker holds the key and forwards the only two Unsplash calls
 * the app makes. Not a passthrough relay — a `/*` proxy would expose the whole
 * API under our key. On `/random` only `RANDOM_PARAMS` survive the hop;
 * `/download` forwards the caller's query whole, minus `client_id`.
 *
 * Lives under `src/` (not a top-level `worker/`) so it stays in the one tree
 * `tsconfig.json` includes and lint scopes to (`lint-config.test.ts` asserts
 * the equality). Safe only while it imports nothing and nothing imports it
 * (`image-proxy.test.ts` pins both): it's type-checked against the *app's* lib
 * set, so a `document`/`localStorage` reference would compile and pass
 * `--dry-run`, then fail in production; and `deploy-worker.yml` redeploys only
 * on `src/worker/**`, so a shared module gets edited without republishing.
 *
 * **Routes are additive.** `registerType: 'prompt'` means a returning player
 * keeps their precached bundle until they accept an update, so one Worker
 * serves every client generation. Renaming/removing a route 404s those clients
 * (they degrade to the bundled image) — add the new route, wait, remove the old.
