/**
 * Repair for a silent gap in bezier-js's `reduce()`.
 *
 * `Bezier.intersects` runs `curveintersects(this.reduce(), ...)`, which
 * only pairs the sub-curves it's handed — so any range `reduce()` drops
 * is unreachable to intersection: a crossing there is not found at all.
 *
 * `reduce()` can drop a range: its `return []` inside a `forEach`
 * callback skips the `if (t1 < 1)` tail-append that would emit the
 * piece, striking when an extremum lands within ~one 0.01 step of a
 * segment boundary. Rare but load-bearing — #498 lost a cut crossing in
 * such a sliver, leaving `buildDCEL` a missing vertex and fusing the
 * four faces around it into one 2×2 piece.

 * into `Bezier.curveintersects`. Not sorted (it pairs all-against-all),
 * so callers must not rely on `t` order.
 *
 * When `reduce()` already covers the curve (the common case) its array
 * is returned as-is, so intersection stays bit-identical to
 * `intersects()` — this keeps the blast radius small, since generated
 * geometry is a reproducibility contract for share links and saves. Not
 * quite neutral where a hole is filled: a middle hole emits its hits
 * before later original parts, so `Curve.intersect`'s first-hit-wins
