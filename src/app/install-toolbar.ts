/**
 * DOM order matters: these controls are absolutely positioned (`src/style.css`
 * by explicit `top`/`right`), so keyboard tab order comes from append order,
 * not visual position — see `installBackgroundColorControl` for the constraint.
 *
 * The info modal's Solve button receives `solve` as a dependency instead of a
 * `window.__solvePuzzle` lookup at click time (the one sanctioned behavior
 * change in this refactor). `bootstrap` binds `dev-hooks.ts`'s `solvePuzzle`
 * once and passes it here and to `installDevHooks`, so the button and console
 * hook are the same function, not two call sites that agree.
