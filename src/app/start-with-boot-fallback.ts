/**
 * The boot flow has no user in front of it: if its `startNewGame` rejects there
 * is no previous puzzle to fall back to and no dialog to retry from, so the
 * session installs nothing and the player faces an empty canvas with nothing
 * said about why (#488). This runs the preferred start, reports a failure, then
 * starts a last-resort puzzle that can't depend on the lazy chunk.
 *
 * Not covered: the fallback keeps the failed attempt's grid size and
 * image-source preferences, so a failure rooted in those inputs repeats against
 * `startFallback` and ends at `BOOT_FAILED_TOAST`. This is a different-generator
 * fallback, not a retry-with-different-inputs one.
