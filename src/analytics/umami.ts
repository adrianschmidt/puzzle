 * `new-game-started[source=fresh]` while its mismatch lands in
 * `piece-count-mismatch[source=dev]`. Count mismatches, don't rate them.
 *
 * That share-link success-rate query also has a third outcome neither term

     * trace-set versions once a v2 ships.
     *
     * For `cutStyle: 'classic'` it carries a SECOND meaning: presence is the

     * `traceSetVersion` approximates the pre-upgrade tail. Consequence for
     * queries: "has traceSetVersion" is no longer a proxy for
     * "Wavy/Triangles" — filter on `cutStyle` explicitly.
     *
     * Three confounds sit in that bucket, all separable:
     * - degraded new games (a failed chunk fetch) land in it — exclude
     *   `tracedChunkDegraded`;
     * - boot-fallback games (#488) land in it too, with no chunk failure of
     *   their own — exclude `bootFallback`;
     * - during a rollout window, clients still on the pre-upgrade build
     *   (PWA caches especially) start Classic games without the field too.
     *   Those are `source: 'fresh'`; a genuine pre-upgrade Classic *link*
     *   arrives as `source: 'shared'`.
     *
     * So the query on `new-game-started` is: `cutStyle: 'classic'`, no
     * `traceSetVersion`, neither `tracedChunkDegraded` nor `bootFallback` —
     * then split on `source`. None of the three exclusions is a negated
     * filter; all are subtractions, the same absence arithmetic

     * is omitted rather than null here and the two flags are absent rather
     * than `false` (each flag's own doc gives the reason), so a negated
     * property filter joins on the key and matches only the rows that carry
     * the property, never the ones that lack it.
     * Both halves count the same one thing: a Classic game that rendered
     * legacy geometry. `'fresh'` is the stale-build population and falls to
     * zero as the fleet turns over. `'shared'` is the link tail, and it is
     * not only pre-upgrade links — anything that reaches a recipient without

     * stale builds opening a *new* link: `isValidPayload` checks known fields
     * only, so an unknown `clf` passes validation and is then ignored.
     * Permanently, it includes links shared from a game that had no sine
     * config of its own to pass on (a degraded start, a resumed pre-upgrade
     * save, a boot-fallback game). That last one is not excludable
     * recipient-side the way a boot fallback's own start is: `bootFallback`
     * rides on the originator's `new-game-started` only, and nothing about
     * it is encoded in the link. All of them genuinely ran the legacy

     * cannot generate lands here too.
     *

 * surface-shape validation but failed while building the puzzle (e.g. a
 * config combination the current build's topology pipeline doesn't support).
 *
 * `reason` is the sanitized error message, and as of the generation worker it
 * has two shapes for one underlying bug: a generation failure raised inside
 * the worker arrives as `'<ErrorName>: <message>'` — the worker-side type is
 * folded into the message, the only field `sanitizeErrorReason` reads —
 * while every other producer arrives bare, including the synchronous fallback
 * running the SAME failing generation for a client with no usable Worker. The
 * two never compare equal, so a per-bug figure has to tolerate the optional
 * prefix; note also that the length cap applies after it is composed, so a
 * long message truncates slightly earlier in the prefixed form. A worker-side
 * name of the default `'Error'` is dropped rather than prefixed, as
 * `generationFallbackReason` above describes.
 *
 * `source` separates the two producers, whose base rates differ sharply.
 * `'shared'` is a real recipient opening a `#p=` link and seeing a
 * "Couldn't load shared puzzle" toast — the signal that watches for
 * share-format regressions. `'repro'` is a developer replaying an info-modal
 * repro block through `__reproPuzzle` in the console, where a generation
 * failure is often the very thing being investigated, so it is an expected
 * outcome rather than user-facing breakage. Without the discriminator the
 * two are indistinguishable, since the differing warn/toast messages never
 * reach analytics. (Named `source` to match {@link ShareFailedData} and
 * {@link UnhandledErrorData}.)
 *
 * Read an ABSENT `source` as `'shared'`: every row predating the
 * discriminator is a real share link, and during the rollout window
 * PWA-cached clients on the previous build keep emitting source-less real
 * failures (the same stale-client confound the `traceSetVersion` note above
 * describes). No property filter can express that, negated or not: event
 * properties are key/value rows, so `source != 'repro'` still joins on the
 * key and matches exactly the rows `source = 'shared'` does. The
 * share-format signal is arithmetic — total `shared-load-failed` minus
 * `source = 'repro'`.

/**
 * Data attached to `piece-count-mismatch` — generation produced a different

 * historical fused-piece bugs shipped undetected before this event existed.
 *
 * The event exists to be ACTED on, not just counted: `seed`, `cutStyle`,
 * `cols`, `rows`, `imageWidth`, `imageHeight`, `rotationMode` and
 * `styleConfig` are exactly the repro params the info modal prints — and
 * that `cutStyle` is not attribution-only: `reproParamsToPayload` throws
 * without it (`repro-params.ts`), so a row missing it from this list would
 * lead an operator to reassemble a `__reproPuzzle` call that fails. A row
 * here can normally be replayed locally through `__reproPuzzle` and turned
 * into a regression test — the exception is the rare row where the
 * per-style config didn't fit and `styleConfig` was replaced by
 * {@link PieceCountMismatchData.styleConfigOmitted}.
 *
 * `expected` and `actual` are PRE-STRIP, GENERATION-GRID counts, while
 * `cols`/`rows` are the USER grid. For a borderless puzzle these legitimately
 * disagree: a borderless 16x12 oversizes to 18x14 = 252 faces before the outer
 * ring is stripped, so `expected: 252` alongside `cols: 16, rows: 12` is
 * correct, not a contradiction. The user grid is what a replay needs.
 *
 * No `delta` property: it is `actual - expected` and both are here, so the
 * CSV export computes it — compute it to triage, not just to size the
 * problem. Its SIGN, not its magnitude, is the discriminator between the two
 * populations described below: a fused-face defect always gives
 * `actual < expected`, a self-intersecting-cut artifact always gives
 * `actual > expected`. So `actual < expected` is the incident query and
 * `actual > expected` is the triage bucket. Magnitude is a weak hint at
 * best — the extreme configs surveyed for #512 overshot by large factors
 * (`expected 48, actual 4881`), but a milder self-intersection lands only a
 * face or two over (`generator.test.ts` pins wavy 2x2 at `hf`/`vf` = 10
 * producing `expected 4, actual 6`), so a small positive delta is normal
 * self-intersection or sliver territory rather than an unexplained row.
 *
 * The sign splits the two populations, but it does NOT partition the
 * incidents: both act on the same counter, so a puzzle carrying a fusion
 * AND a sliver reports only their net. A fused pair (-1) alongside one
 * sliver (+1) lands on `actual == expected` and fires nothing at all; a
 * fusion alongside two slivers files as the benign `actual > expected`
 * bucket. Slivers are common enough (see below) that this is not a corner
 * case. So `actual < expected` is a LOWER BOUND on fusion incidents, not a
 * complete list of them — a clean positive-delta export means "no fusion
 * large enough to outweigh the slivers on the same puzzle", not "no
 * fusions".
 *
 * `imageUrl` is deliberately absent. Cut geometry is a function of the seed,
 * the grid, the image SIZE, the style and the style config — the image bytes
 * do not enter it, and `reproParamsToPayload` defaults a missing image to a
 * blank puzzle, so a replay is geometrically identical without it. Shipping
 * it in any form would also be the first exception to the redaction rule
 * {@link TracedChunkLoadFailedData} follows.
 *
 * `imageUrl` and `styleConfig` are the two fields this schema treats as
 * capable of running long, and each is handled by the mechanism that fits
 * it: `imageUrl` cannot be usefully shortened — a truncated URL is a broken
 * one — so it is dropped unconditionally, at build time. `styleConfig` is
 * usually a handful of numbers but occasionally unbounded (see
 * {@link PieceCountMismatchData.styleConfigOmitted}), so it is checked and
 * dropped only at runtime, only on the rows that actually cross Umami's
 * 500-char string limit. Both follow the same principle: never ship
 * something that looks replayable and isn't.
 *
 * `source` separates real players from developer investigation. Two
 * non-player values: replaying a known-bad puzzle through `__reproPuzzle`
 * re-runs generation and re-fires this event (`source = 'repro'`), and
 * `__newComposableGame`/other dev-console starts do the same for arbitrary
 * cut parameters (`source = 'dev'`) — at 2x shipped Wavy's frequency, for
 * instance, a developer poking at the console mismatches on essentially
 * every seed, and dev-deploy reports to the same Umami website ID as
 * production. Both must be excluded when counting incidents, and here that
 * exclusion is a POSITIVE filter: the player-facing population is
 * `source in ('fresh', 'shared')`.
 *
 * Deliberately not the subtraction {@link SharedLoadFailedData}'s `source`
 * needs. That one is subtractive because it was added to an already-shipping
 * event, so its absent rows have to be read as `'shared'` and no filter can
 * express "absent". This `source` shipped with the event, is required, and is
 * set unconditionally at both emit sites, so every row carries one of the four
 * values and the positive form is exact. It is also the safer of the two under
 * change: a future FIFTH `source` value would be counted as player traffic by
 * the subtraction and left out by the positive form, so the mistake it makes
 * is visible (a total that no longer adds up) rather than silent.
 *
 * `source` does not catch every developer row, and the gap is a filterable
 * one rather than a labeled one: SUBTRACT `source = 'fresh' AND cutStyle =
 * 'composable'` as well. The dev console is not the only route to an
 * arbitrary sine config — the new-game dialog offers Composable, with H/V
 * Frequency sliders reaching 10 (`new-game-dialog.ts`), wherever
 * `isComposableVisible()` is true, which is `npm run dev` AND the
 * `/puzzle/dev/` preview deploy (`cut-styles.ts`). That dialog binding is a
 * plain `startNewGame(...)`, so it reports `'fresh'`. Those rows are still
 * developer traffic by construction: the production build filters Composable
 * out of the dialog, so a production player cannot select it, and the only
 * legitimate production composable puzzle arrives from a share link — which
 * reports `'shared'`. A production row with `source = 'fresh'` and
 * `cutStyle = 'composable'` therefore means a saved Composable *preference*
 * replayed through the save-less boot path (`boot-sequence.ts`), which only
 * someone who used dev-deploy can have set (the two share an origin, so they
 * share localStorage). Note this subtraction covers `cutStyle` `'composable'`
 * only: `'wavy'` and `'triangles'` are composable-backed but ship as fixed
 * production presets, so their `'fresh'` rows are real players.
 *
 * Unlike the other `source`/`cutStyle` rules here, that one is COMPOUND — it
 * names two properties of the same row, and the two must be correlated per
 * event. (The `delta` note above is the other compound reading in this block:
 * `actual < expected` is likewise two properties of one row.) Do not
 * substitute two independent subtractions: removing `source = 'fresh'` and
 * then `cutStyle = 'composable'` takes out their UNION, not their
 * intersection, which over-subtracts and undercounts real incidents (every
 * genuine `'fresh'` Wavy row goes with it). Count this one from a per-event
 * view, where a single row carries both properties — the same export the
 * `delta` note above needs for the same reason — not by combining the two
 * per-property totals.
 *
 * That subtraction is sound only while Composable stays dev-only. Shipping it
 * to production — `isComposableVisible()` returning true for a production
 * build — makes `'fresh'` + `'composable'` a real player, and this rule starts
 * silently discarding genuine incidents. Delete it in the same change, and
 * label the dev routes some other way if they still need excluding.
 *
 * A residual neither rule removes: a composable share link CREATED on a dev
 * build and opened on `/puzzle/dev/` reports `'shared'` like any other
 * recipient, and dev-deploy shares production's website ID — the page path
 * (`/puzzle/` vs `/puzzle/dev/`, as above) is the only thing separating the
 * two. Since an extreme sine config mismatches on essentially
 * every seed, one review link opened a few times reads as several field
 * incidents. Slice by `url` before treating a cluster of `'shared'` +
 * `'composable'` rows as production. Left as a query caveat on purpose: the
 * code cannot tell a dev-built link from a real one at open time, and a
 * `source` that tried to would suppress genuine preview signal.
 *
 * Not every row is a bug: exotic composable configs (e.g. sine `hf`/`vf` = 10
 * on a small grid) can self-intersect and carve genuine island faces, so the
 * real face count legitimately exceeds the declared one — always `actual >
 * expected`, by anything from a couple of faces to a factor of a hundred —
 * without a fused- or dropped-piece defect behind it. Treat this event as a
 * lead to replay and inspect, not an automatic incident count.
 *
 * A small positive delta has a second, even more benign explanation worth
 * ruling out first: sub-pixel sliver faces left over from curve-intersection
 * rounding. Those are real extra faces in the DCEL, so they count in `actual`
 * — the auto-group pass merges them into a neighbour's starting group but
 * never removes them (`auto-group.ts`: "leaves the topology untouched"), so
 * where the check sits relative to that pass makes no difference to this
 * number. What the pass does change is visibility: a sliver the player never
 * sees as a separate piece still shows up here. The area floor below which
 * one gets absorbed is per style (`avgPieceArea / 4` for Classic and Wavy,
 * `DEFAULT_MIN_PIECE_AREA` for a composable game that sets none), so a puzzle
 * with a handful of sub-threshold faces is unremarkable. Replay before
 * reading a small overshoot as a defect.

     *   covers a crafted link's deeply-nested config as much as the dev-console
     *   `__newComposableGame` live object — the live object is the one source
     *   that can construct a CIRCULAR config, but being `JSON.parse` output
     *   bounds neither depth nor size: the parser accepts nesting far past the
     *   point `JSON.stringify` overflows at, and `isValidComposableCf` checks
     *   only that `bgc`/`tgc` are non-null objects (`sharing/share-link.ts`).
     *   The save's stringify walks the same chain one level deeper —
     *   `serializeStatic` nests `composableConfig` under a wrapper object
     *   (`persistence/serialization.ts`) — so it overflows on a SHALLOWER
     *   config than the builder's would, and still throws first. The builder's
     *   `try` is defense in depth against that ordering changing.
     *
     * So every `styleConfigOmitted` row an operator can see is over-limit,
     * whatever its `source`.
     *
     * Legacy Classic — whose *absence* of `classicConfig` is load-bearing,
     * selecting the legacy generator — cannot produce this event at all: it
     * runs `generateProceduralPuzzle` and never reaches a checked base cut.
     *
     * Mutually exclusive with `styleConfigOmitted`: at most one of the two is
     * ever present, so the event never carries more than the 12 documented
     * properties.
     *
     * Unlike every other field here, this one is not validated against the
     * redaction convention {@link TracedChunkLoadFailedData} follows:
     * composable's `baseCutConfig`/`tabConfig` pass through from the share
     * link's wire format unvalidated (see `styleConfigOmitted` below), so a
     * crafted link can place an arbitrary string under 500 chars in here —
     * e.g. `{ u: "https://..." }` — and it ships verbatim. That the OTHER four
     * blocks cannot do the same is a property of the decoder, not of their
     * types: every field they reconstruct from is type-checked or clamped on
     * decode (`ff.bl`/`wf.bl` must be booleans; `wf.tv`/`tf.tv`/`clf.tv` are
     * clamped to a known trace-set version or dropped). Loosen any of those
     * and this field's exposure widens beyond composable — and a `wavy` or
     * `triangles` row lands OUTSIDE the `cutStyle = 'composable'` filter an
     * operator would reach for. Two things not to understate about that: the
     * trigger is reliable rather than incidental (an extreme sine config
     * mismatches on essentially every seed, so one opened link puts a chosen
     * string in the dataset on demand), and "never rendered" is true of the
     * app, not of the Umami dashboard, which is where an operator actually
     * reads this. Impact is still bounded — 500 chars of attacker-authored
     * text, no victim data, landing only in our own dataset — so the gap is
     * left open deliberately: filtering keys here would silently change what
     * a legitimate composable repro carries, which would break the replay
     * guarantee this event exists for.
     * Validating the composable config's shape belongs with the share-link
     * decoder (#491), not with this payload builder.

     * when the config does not serialize at all, but no such row can reach
     * Umami — the save on the way to this event stringifies the same config
     * first and throws, see the absence list on {@link
     * PieceCountMismatchData.styleConfig} — so read this flag as "over-limit".
     * A row with this flag is **not** replayable as-is through `__reproPuzzle`
     * — the config needed to regenerate the exact cut is missing — but every

     * `rotationMode`) is still valid and the `expected`/`actual` counts are
     * unaffected.
     *
     * In practice this means `cutStyle: 'composable'`: `composableConfig`'s
     * `baseCutConfig`/`tabConfig` are opaque `Record<string, unknown>`

     * are non-null objects — no size or shape bound — so a crafted share
     * link can produce a config large enough to cross the limit. None of the
     * other four per-style config blocks can be driven there from a share
     * link: they carry only booleans and clamped trace-set versions, and the
     * decoder enforces exactly that — see the note on {@link
     * PieceCountMismatchData.styleConfig}, which depends on the same
     * enforcement. Truncating instead of omitting was rejected: truncated
     * JSON does not parse, so a truncated `styleConfig` would look replayable

     * complement is arithmetic, not a filter: rows NOT dropped for size are
     * total `piece-count-mismatch` minus that. `styleConfigOmitted != true`
     * does not express it — the property's only value is `true`, so that
     * filter joins on the key and then excludes every row it matched, i.e. it
     * returns nothing at all. (Sharper than the same absence problem {@link
     * SharedLoadFailedData}'s `source` has: there the two-valued field at
     * least matches the rows that carry it.) Note the complement is "not
     * dropped for size", not "carried a config": it also contains the rows

 * **Not a synonym for "cross-tab takeover".** It counts two distinct causes,

 * 1. **The cross-tab race** (#404) — another tab started a puzzle over this

 *    torn save and a false "corrupt" dialog. Every later autosave of this
 *    tab's puzzle mismatches too, so it shows up as a *run*.
 * 2. **A new puzzle too large to store.** When `saveNewPuzzle`'s geometry
 *    write fails on quota (the #487/#399 large-save regime), the *previous*
 *    puzzle's geometry stays in the slot and the token correctly still names
 *    it — so every autosave of the new puzzle mismatches and skips, for the
 *    rest of the session, with no second tab involved at all. Note this
 *    produces exactly the shape a sustained takeover would: a long run of this
 *    event from one user.
 *
 * A new game does *not* strand a save here: `GameSession.install` cancels the
 * outgoing puzzle's pending autosave before the new geometry takes the slot,
 * so the doomed save never flushes (#514). Before that fix it was a third
 * cause — an isolated skip around every new game started with an active
 * multi-select selection — so sessions predating the fix can still show it.
 *
 * Discriminating them is per-session inspection, not arithmetic on the totals.
 * `save-failed` with `op: 'new-puzzle'` is the useful marker but it neither
 * counts nor filters: cause 2 emits *one* of it ahead of a run of *many*
 * skips, so the two counts are at different granularities and differencing
 * them is meaningless; and `op: 'new-puzzle'` also fires when the geometry
 * write succeeded and only the initial *progress* write hit quota
 * (`saveNewPuzzle` reports the worse of the two), which produces no skipped
 * run at all. Absence is not filterable here either (see
 * {@link NewGameFailedData}). So read sessions: a `save-failed{op:'new-puzzle'}`
 * followed by a long run is cause 2; a long run with no `save-failed` is
 * cause 1.
 *
 * Since #490 the comparison reads the derived `puzzle-geometry-seed` token
 * instead of decoding the geometry blob. That does not add a cause: every path
 * the app can take keeps the token equal to the seed of the blob in the slot —
 * it is re-anchored on load, dropped on a foreign geometry write and on a
 * bfcache restore, and left alone on a failed geometry write (which is what
 * makes cause 2 a correct skip rather than a bug). A token written by foreign
 * same-origin script is the one thing that could make it lie, and no dimension
 * separates that case.

 * on both events, so "cancel rate by grid" divides two comparable
 * buckets. (The fresh path's requested grid is always landscape-

 *
 * `elapsedMs` is overlay-shown → cancel, so it includes image fetch time,

 * canceling only takes effect at the next abort checkpoint, so a click

 * however long was left on it. The chunk fetch alone can precede a
 * `source: 'shared'` cancel too: a shared load has no Unsplash fetch, but

 * leg does not make a shared cancel's `elapsedMs` click-accurate. A click
