  // chunk, loaded by src/game/generation-worker-core.ts) gets inlined into
  // the worker's single output file instead of staying a separate,
  // on-demand chunk. That means every worker spawn — including a plain
  // classic-cut generation that never touches traced tabs — parses a
  // baked-in copy of the traced-tab dataset. 'es' lets the worker's build
  // code-split like the main thread's. Module workers are widely
  // supported; on a browser without module-worker support, per the
  // WHATWG HTML spec the script fetch/execution failure surfaces
  // asynchronously as an `error` event on the Worker (not a synchronous
  // throw from the constructor), which generate-async.ts's `error` listener
  // already turns into the synchronous main-thread fallback — so
  // there's no new failure mode to handle.
